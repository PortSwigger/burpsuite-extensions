<p>This extension enables security testers to view, decode, and modify SAML 
Authentication requests and test IdP's response to their manipulations.</p>
<p>Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is used in many single sign-on 
(SSO) implementations, which authenticate the user once to access several 
Service Providers (SP). When a user tries to access a SP, it redirects the user 
to an Identification Provider (IdP) and adds "SAML authentication request" to 
the redirection request, to which the user is authenticated according. </p>
<p>The extension supports the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Decodes SAML authentication requests, whether compressed in the URL
    (HTTP Redirection Binding) or not compressed in POST body (HTTP POST
    Binding).</li>
  <li>
    Displays the decoded SAML authentication request in Proxy Intercept,
    Proxy History and Repeater tabs.</li>
</ul>
