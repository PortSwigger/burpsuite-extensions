<p>Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is used in many SSO
implementations, which authenticate the user once to access several Service
Providers (SP). When a user tries to access a SP, it redirects the user to an
Identification Provider (IdP) and adds "SAML authentication request" to the
redirection request, to which the user is authenticated according. SAML ReQuest
Burp extension enables pentesters to view, decode and modify SAML
Authentication requests and test IdP's response to their manipulations.</p>

    Binding)
  </li>
  <li>
